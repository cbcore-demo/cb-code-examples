No need to use 'General job definition', can just define attribute with ID 'myParam' in the form above the job template pipeline.


pipeline {
    agent any 
    stages {
        stage('Build') { 
            steps {
                echo "This is the build stage ${myParam}"
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { 
            steps {
                echo 'This is the test stage'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') { 
            steps {
                echo 'This is the deploy stage'
            }
        }
    }
}
